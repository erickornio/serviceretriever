* In replay existing message dialog, allow save button to update saved message, and maybe "save as new" (also change the title of this dialog to better explain that's it's replaying from liibrary)

* In manual test dialod, button to save transaction to library

* Save message to library panel should have a button to jump to "replay" once the message is saved

* need toggle to disable service (or version, method?). should also keep transactions against disabled service as failures maybe?

* handle failing HTTP gets better and allow non-secure client auth: "Failure was: peer not authenticated"

* Clicking save a second time on Add user dialog should update the newly created user

* Security column should have an indicator for services with some unsecured methods, or "ALLOW_ANY" status 

* Should log transactions where the rerquest type is GET as failed transactions (as well as other reasons to throw ProcessingException?)

* client and server auths should know what type of service versions they can apply to

* Active checks should average latency over more than one subsequent call somehow.. This is hard because it's URL specific. The
  alert email should ideally contain the last few latency checks too, and really it would be nice if the alert email showed 
  the non-failing URLs too.

* recreate URL statuses if they disappear

* Replace service version status bean with method status bean and update UI to display the method last
  invocation time

* Allow recent transactions to be pinned 

* edit keystore and truststore in HTTP client config are upside down (keystore should be first)

* edit keystore and truststore should show key info, maybe allow download?

* Adding a new svcversion with an existing domain but a new service causes the redirect on save to fail

* need delete button for svcversions

* backing URL panel  should have a domain column 

* view recent transactions should cause a flush

* HTTP client config should be created per service version with the option to link (and defaults should
  be set on each new one)

* user list page should refresh stats

----
DONE

* keep method ref in recent transactions, and display it in the 
  recent transactions table (also maybe use it in the auto generated
  title for saved transactions)
  
* Message library view: Need an "add" button, should also be able to choose which SVCVER to display, or to display all 
  messages in the library. Also columns should be sortable
