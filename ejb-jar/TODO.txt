* Allow individual methods to require explicit authorization (make sure this is saved when refreshing WSDLs too)

* In replay existing message dialog, allow save button to update saved message, and maybe "save as new" (also change the title of this dialog to better explain that's it's replaying from liibrary)
* In manual test dialod, button to save transaction to library

* Save message to library panel should have a button to jump to "replay" once the message is saved

* need toggle to disable service (or version, method?). should also keep transactions against disabled service as failures maybe?

----
DONE

* keep method ref in recent transactions, and display it in the 
  recent transactions table (also maybe use it in the auto generated
  title for saved transactions)
  
* Message library view: Need an "add" button, should also be able to choose which SVCVER to display, or to display all 
  messages in the library. Also columns should be sortable

    Table mods:
   	PX_SVC_VER_RCNT_MSG needs new METHOD_PID column
   	PX_USER_RCNT_MSG needs new METHOD_PID column
   	All hierarchy needs new SEC_POLICY (len 50) column
