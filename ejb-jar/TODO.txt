* Allow individual methods to require explicit authorization (make sure this is saved when refreshing WSDLs too)

* In replay existing message dialog, allow save button to update saved message, and maybe "save as new" (also change the title of this dialog to better explain that's it's replaying from liibrary)
* In manual test dialod, button to save transaction to library

* Save message to library panel should have a button to jump to "replay" once the message is saved

* need toggle to disable service (or version, method?). should also keep transactions against disabled service as failures maybe?

* handle failing HTTP gets better and allow non-secure client auth: "Failure was: peer not authenticated"

* Clicking save a second time on Add user dialog should update the newly created user

* Security column should have an indicator for services with some unsecured methods, or "ALLOW_ANY" status 

* URL list should show CB status and allow a reset

* Should log transactions where the rerquest type is GET as failed transactions (as well as other reasons to throw ProcessingException?)

* Should store the first HTTP line in the request body  

* Monitor active checks should store URL latency and the last response text and allow you to manually trigger them 
  and show the results of the last test in the panel
  
* Deleting URLs from SvcVers doesn't work if they have failed and have rule checks against them

* client and server auths should know what type of service versions they can apply to

* Active checks should average latency over more than one subsequent call somehow.. This is hard because it's URL specific. The
  alert email should ideally contain the last few latency checks too, and really it would be nice if the alert email showed 
  the non-failing URLs too.

* Edit serviceversion dialog shouldn't allow you to change the domain and service on a service once it's saved. 

* recreate URL statuses if they disappear

----
DONE

* keep method ref in recent transactions, and display it in the 
  recent transactions table (also maybe use it in the auto generated
  title for saved transactions)
  
* Message library view: Need an "add" button, should also be able to choose which SVCVER to display, or to display all 
  messages in the library. Also columns should be sortable
